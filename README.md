# Learning - Python and FastAPI

This is the repo documenting my steps learning FastAPI with Python as documented on [my site](https://www.kevineaton.net/post/new_tech/python_fastapi/00_overview/).

## Background

When learning a new technology, I prefer to build something that's a bit more complicated than a single feature. In this case, I'm building a [basic user authentication API](https://kevineaton.net/post/new_tech/project_overview/).

Ultimately, there will be non-ideal decisions. It's learning a new technology, after all. **Under no circumstances does this reflect a production-ready, well-designed system.** It simply is a place to document and store my learning journey. If it helps you in anyway, awesome! But it is not intended to be a deployable, production, secured system.

## Stack

I've never used FastAPI prior to this. I used Python for scripting and some toy experiments, but never in production at scale, and never with a framework. I've spent most of my time in Go, so I wanted to stretch in another direction. The desired endstate is a working authentication system with:

- Python
- FastAPI
- MySQL

Specific libraries beyond that are to be decided!
